          <h3>Death</h3>
          <p>
            In 2011, Randhawa was studying at the Lahore Grammar School
            Paragon Campus in her second year of A-levels. On 22 December
            2011, she had a cardiac arrest after an epileptic seizure that
            damaged her brain and was admitted to Lahore's Combined Military
            Hospital (CMH) in critical condition. On 9 January 2012, Bill
            Gates, chairman of Microsoft, contacted Randhawa's parents and
            directed her doctors to adopt "every kind of measure" for her
            treatment. Gates set up a special panel of international doctors
            who remained in contact with her local doctors through
            teleconference. The panel assisted in diagnosing and treating her
            illness. Local doctors dismissed the option of moving Randhawa to
            another hospital due to her being on a ventilator and in critical
            condition. Members of her family have lauded Bill Gates for
            offering to bear her treatment expenses. Randhawa began to improve
            on 13 January 2012, and some areas of her brain began to show
            indications of healing. Microsoft had discussed flying her to the
            United States for treatment, according to her father, Amjad Abdul
            Karim Randhawa. Randhawa died at a hospital in Lahore on 14
            January 2012, aged 16. Her funeral, which was held on the
            following day, was attended by the Chief Minister of Punjab,
            Shahbaz Sharif. She was buried in her ancestral village Chak No.
            4JB Ram Diwali, on Faisalabad-Sargodha Road Faisalabad.
